# Benefits of using an assistant/agent for developers with motor disabilities

This note summarizes practical benefits and recommended features of an AI coding assistant for developers who have motor disabilities. It is intentionally concise and focused on actionable value.

Why an agent helps

- Reduce repetitive typing: Agents can generate code templates, refactorings, and boilerplate so less manual typing is required.
- Minimize precise pointer/keyboard use: Voice or short-command driven interactions let developers perform complex edits without fine motor control.
- Speed up navigation: An agent can open files, jump to symbols, and run builds/tests on demand, avoiding repeated keyboard shortcuts or mouse gestures.
- Automate routine workflows: Commits, CI commands, test runs, and patch generation can be scripted by the agent, reducing physical steps.
- Lower cognitive load: The agent explains changes, suggests small diffs, and provides safe options (preview, undo) so decisions require less sustained manual effort.

Concrete examples of value

- “Generate unit test for function X” — agent writes the test, runs it, and reports results.
- “Refactor this file to extract method” — agent performs the edit and stages the change for review.
- “Search and replace across project with preview” — agent shows a preview before applying.
- “Create a PR with summary and tests” — agent prepares branch, commit, and PR text ready for review.

Recommended assistant features for accessibility

- Voice-first / natural-language command support with optional transcription.
- Small, confirmable changes by default (preview + explicit apply). No destructive changes without confirmation.
- Keyboard-friendly and screen-reader friendly UI/outputs (clear labels, short messages, compact diffs).
- Rate-limited or chunked outputs so reading/scrolling is manageable.
- Persistent context and session memory so commands can be short and incremental.

Privacy and safety notes

- Always show the exact diffs the agent will apply; require an explicit approval step before committing or pushing.
- Keep local-only operation mode available (no network calls) for sensitive codebases.
- Log actions and provide an undo mechanism for any automated edits.

Team & workflow suggestions

- Add a simple checklist for agent-generated commits: summary, test results, and required reviewers.
- Use the agent to create small, reviewable commits rather than large monolithic changes.
- Document agent capabilities and safe-usage guidelines in project CONTRIBUTING.md so reviewers know what to expect.

Closing

An assistant that follows these principles reduces the manual interaction burden, improves developer productivity, and helps make the project more inclusive. Small safeguards (preview, undo, local-only mode) preserve control and trust while giving substantial accessibility gains.
